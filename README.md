# pivx-draft

This is a draft repo for the pivx module. Final structure will be decided when we go into the Godot integration phase, at which point we might split into multiple repos

## Roadmap:

- Make libbtc portable
- Test the basic functionality:
    - create and sign transaction
	- create and sign segwit transaction,
	- create addresses from bip44 seed
- Finalize C++ api
- Godot 3.x integration
- Godot 2.1 integration
- Documentation

First 3 points are happening simmultaneously
